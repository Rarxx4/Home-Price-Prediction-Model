# Home Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook to predict home prices based on various housing features. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Overview

House price prediction is a common regression problem in machine learning. This project uses structured housing data to train a regression model capable of estimating house prices based on input features such as area, number of rooms, and other property characteristics.

The notebook is designed to be easy to understand and is suitable for beginners who want hands-on experience with real-world machine learning problems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of housing-related features where each row represents a house. Typical features include:

- Property size
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location-related attributes
- Other numerical or categorical variables

The target variable is the house price.

1. Loading and inspecting the dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis  
4. Feature selection and preparation  
5. Training regression models  
6. Evaluating model performance  
7. Making predictions
